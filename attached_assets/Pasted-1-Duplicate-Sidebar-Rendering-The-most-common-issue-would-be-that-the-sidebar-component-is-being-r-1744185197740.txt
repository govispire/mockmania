1. Duplicate Sidebar Rendering

The most common issue would be that the sidebar component is being rendered multiple times, likely within your layout or the page structure. To resolve this:

    Ensure the sidebar is only rendered once. Check if you have inadvertently added the sidebar component in both your main layout and inside your pages or components.

Solution:

    Main Layout: Ensure the sidebar is only part of the main layout and not directly included in any page or sub-component thatâ€™s already inside the layout.

    For example, in your MainLayout component, the sidebar should look like this:

const MainLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="layout">
      <Sidebar />  {/* Only include Sidebar here */}
      <main>{children}</main>
    </div>
  );
};

And in your pages, do not add the sidebar again. Only the children (content) should be rendered inside MainLayout.

Page Component: When rendering a page, make sure you are only passing the content to the layout without rendering the sidebar again.

Example:

    export default function DashboardPage() {
      return (
        <MainLayout>
          <div className="dashboard-content">
            {/* Content goes here */}
          </div>
        </MainLayout>
      );
    }

2. Improper Layout Nesting

Sometimes, the layout may be nested incorrectly. For example, if your sidebar is placed inside MainLayout and DashboardLayout separately, it could render twice.
Solution:

    Check for Nested Layouts: Ensure that you're not wrapping the MainLayout inside another layout that also includes the sidebar.

For example, if DashboardLayout includes the sidebar, don't render MainLayout with a sidebar again. You could fix this by using just one layout:

// If your DashboardLayout already has a sidebar, just use that.
const DashboardLayout = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div className="dashboard-layout">
      <Sidebar /> {/* Don't include another sidebar here */}
      <div className="main-content">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

3. Check CSS or Flexbox Styles

Sometimes, CSS styles or flex properties could cause visual issues, such as two sidebars overlapping. If this is the case, inspect the layout in the browser using the Developer Tools and ensure that the layout styles are correct.
4. Check for Component Duplication

If you're using a component that includes the sidebar, make sure the component isn't imported or used multiple times by mistake.
Solution:

    Ensure Components are Unique: Double-check your imports and ensure you're not mistakenly rendering the sidebar multiple times.

import Sidebar from "@/components/Sidebar";

Make sure that Sidebar is not imported into any child components of MainLayout unless it's required.
